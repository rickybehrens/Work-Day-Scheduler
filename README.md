# Work Day Scheduler

## The following Daily Scheduler works in the following manner:

```md
  - The updated date and time is displayed on the header of the page.
  - The schedule is based out of a regular 9am to 5pm work hours.
  - Anything that has past from your current time will be displayed in gray.
  - The current time block will desplay in red.
  - Any future time blocks will be in green.
  - If you'd like to save a new appointment, you simply click on the desired time of day and input the appointment's details and click the "save" button. Once you click on save button, you'll see the following message "Appointment Added to localStorage ✔️".
    * NOTE: please not that the save button only works for each independent hour block. If you input appointments in different hour blocks, you have to click on each "save" button of those hour blocks. Other wise, you will only store the information of the blocks you click save on.
  - If you decide to make any modifications or remove a previous appointment, remember to click the "save" button after deleting or modifying the appointment's details, otherwise it will remain unchanged.
    * NOTE: in the case that you complete delete the appointment of the time block and click the "save" button, you'll get the following message "Appointment Deleted form localStorage ✔️"

```
